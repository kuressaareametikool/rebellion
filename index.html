		<u>Rebellion Developments Limited</u> is an English video game developer based in Oxford, England, known for its Sniper Elite series and multiple games in the Alien vs. Predator series.
		<br><br>
		Rebellion was established by brothers Jason and Chris Kingsley in 1992. The team was later expanded to include artists Stuart Wilson, Toby Banfield, and Justin Rae and programmers Mike Beaton, Rob Dibley, and Andrew Whittaker. This expanded team was hired initially in order to work on two Atari Jaguar titles, one of which was the high-profile release Alien vs Predator (1994).
		<br><br>
		Two games from Rebellion are being released in 2012: NeverDead, published by Konami and directed by Shinta Nojiri (who was involved in the development of the Metal Gear Solid series of games), and Sniper Elite V2, which is being co-published with 505 Games. In July 2013, Rebellion bought the Battlezone and the Moonbase Commander franchises from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings.
		<br><br>
		In 2014, a sequel to Sniper Elite V2, Sniper Elite III was released.
		<br><br>
		In September 2015, Rebellion announced that the Sniper Elite series had passed 10 million copies sold worldwide and also celebrated its 10th anniversary in that year.

		<font color="pink">Rogue Trooper is a third-person shooter video game developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Eidos Interactive.The story is set on the planet Nu-Earth, which is caught in the gravitational forces of two suns and a black hole (used by Southers to warp into their space station high command), where a perpetual war between the Norts and Southers is being fought, in which millions have been killed. During the war all forms of chemical and biological weapons have been used, poisoning the planet, and the troops of both sides must live in enclosed cities and only venture into the outside if wearing protective gear known as a "bio-suit". The Southers have, through genetic engineering (done by the so-called "gene genies"), developed a race of warriors who are immune to the deadly atmosphere and will therefore be superior troops, the Genetic Infantry</font>
